# Game-Of-Life
An Implementation of John Conways Game of Life Using C++ and The Windows console

-The program can run a default simulation of the game or accept a file containing the initial state of the board and use that instead.
-Also, in the file containing the initial state of the board, remember to write the number of columns and the number of rows above the board in the file and seperate them by a space or write them on seperate lines.
-Also, after the columns and rows type out the symbol representing life cells on your board
-Lastly you can draw your board in the file.
-An example file for input will be posted in the repository
